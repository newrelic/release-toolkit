## Unreleased

### Notes

`ohi-release-notes` action was only used by Coreint team and it has been moved to their repository: 
[`coreint-automation` PR](https://github.com/newrelic/coreint-automation/pull/83)

`generate-yaml` failed to create an empty YAML by default. The composable nature of `release-toolkit`
encourages the user to hack the YAML if needed. This is also needed so an empty YAML is there for the
other actions like `is-empty` or `is-held` to work properly.

`next-version` should also follow the composable nature of `release-toolkit`. But this part of the tool
should fail if there is no new version in case a user hack the YAML to a point that is not bumping the
version. Not failing can lead scripts to override an already existing version. This is also a change
on the default behavior.

### Breaking
