NAME:
   $0 - release toolkit wrapper to create release notes for OHIs

USAGE:
   $0 [options]

DESCRIPTION:
   Wrapper for release toolkit that runs commands needed to create the release notes for an OHI:
    * rt validate-markdown
    * rt generate-yaml
    * rt is-empty
    * rt is-held
    * rt link-dependencies
    * rt update-markdown (with the version calculated from the next-version command)
    * rt render-changelog (with the version calculated from the next-version command)

   At the end of the run, this command should output two files and a string:
    * CHANGELOG.md updated with the last changelog rendered.
    * A CHANGELOG.partial.md with the changes for this release only.
    * The version that was computed for this release.

OPTIONS:
   --git-root                       Run all the command using this path as root
   --verbose                        Adds verbose mode to this script.
   --help                           Show this help message and exits.
   --excluded-dirs                  Exclude commits whose changes only impact files in specified dirs relative to repository root. Defaults to ".github".
   --excluded-files                 Exclude commits whose changes only impact files in the list, paths relative to repository root. Defaults to "".
   --included-dirs                  Only scan commits scoping at least one file in any of the following comma-separated directories Defaults to "".
   --included-files                 Only scan commits scoping at least one file in the following comma-separated list. Defaults to "".
   --no-fail                        Do not fail even in the held toggle is active
   --dictionary                     Sets the link dependency dictionary file path. Default file located at "$DICTIONARY_URL" is used.
   --excluded-dependencies-manifest Sets the excluded dependencies manifest. Default file located at "$EXCLUDED_DEPENDENCIES_MANIFEST_URL".
