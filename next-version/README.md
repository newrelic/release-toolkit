# üõ†Ô∏è `next-version`

Compute next version according to changelog.yaml and Semver conventions. It will output the major version and the minor too, so it can be used to tag actions and docker images that do not need to be pinned to the whole version but to respect the interface that it has.

## Example Usage

Example generating the next version from a repo with version tags with last release tag `my-project-1.0.1:
```yaml
- name: Calculate next version
  uses: newrelic/release-toolkit/next-version@v1
  with:
    tag-prefix: my-project-
```

If for example there are breaking changes, the output will be `v2.0.0`, `v2.0`, and `v2`.

## Outputs

`next-version`: Returns Semver next version, with leading v. E.g.: `v3.4.1`
`next-version-major`: Returns only the major version, with leading v. E.g.: `v3`
`next-version-major-minor`: Returns major and minor version, with leading v. E.g.: `v3.4`

## Parameters

All parameters are optional and match the ones used for the cli command flag, you can see the values and the defaults in [here](../README.md#next-version))
